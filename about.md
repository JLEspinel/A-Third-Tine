Welcome to A Third Tine, a small blog run by Jose Espinel, with occasional contributions by friends and guest writers.

Main areas of focus include business, science, and philosophy, but there may be the occasional unrelated post about movies, travel, or some other surprise that you might unexpectedly enjoy.

### More Information

Jose Espinel studies Economics and Astrophyics in Boston. He tries to be candid about most things.
