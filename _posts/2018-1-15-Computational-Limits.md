Outline:

- idea was convergent evolution from three sources:
	1. Conversation with Lucas Rosen
    2. Rationality: AI to Zombies, "Mind does not have floating point limitations"
    3. Slate Star Codex, "DMT superhuman being test (mental moonmen can't factor large numbers)"
- give Stanford definitions:
	- break down the components of a Turing machine
    1. block of memory
    2. symbols can be stored in block of memory
    3. computers are limited both by the speed of computations and by limited storage
    	it takes a nonzero amount of time to recall a symbol from or assign it to a block of memory
    
- begs the question... what's the upper limit of human calculations, and is there a limit to the amount of informaiton the mind can store?

- are there empirically determined or postulated limits?
	- what's the history of these limits?
    - who has talked about it? any cool anecdotes?
    - where are they now?

This post is dedicated to all you lucid dreamers.

It's the covergent evolution of three recent encounters with one question: what are the computational limits of the human mind?

Encounter 1 (~ 3 days ago): I was talking about lucid dreaming with a friend (Lucas Rosen). More specifically, we were talking about the brain's remarkable ability to conjure up entire personalities and landscapes seemingly on command while we dream. 

Encounter 2 (~ 1 week ago): In Book 2 of Rationality: AI to Zombies, Yudkowski makes the following statement:

> Unsurprisingly, the human brain doesn’t do 64-bit floating-point arithmetic, and it can’t devalue the emotional force of a pleasant anticipation by a factor of 0.00000001 without dropping the line of reasoning entirely.

When read in context, it's found in a section that really has nothing to do with computational limits (it's an esssay on lotteries, of all things). But it stuck with me.

Encounter 3 (~ 2 days ago):



We know, however, that dreams don't happen in real time. When you're
