I propose a toast to Lucas Szwarcberg, Dan Brickell, and [Scott Alexander](slatestarcodex.com) for inspring this site. Men undoubtedly cut from the same cloth.

It took a month of living with Lucas and Dan in Tel Aviv and listening to them ascerbicly prodding each other with dry, hyper-rational wit to make me assume two stances (I'm hesistant to call them "truths" for fear of contributing to part of the problem): first, that the world - our world, in 2018, with its sweeping tracts of untruths and tractionless scandals endlessly dominating the daily news cycles - needs better stories, and second, that those stories ought to be studied wholly and rationally, rather than in dogmatically convenient parts as is now in vogue.

Read a lot, write a little is the guiding principle behind this blog. If well executed, each post should boil down one or several interesting reads I've recently wandered into. If very well executed, each post should also be enjoyable - to the point you'll share it. Long shot, I know, but here's to a year of risks.
