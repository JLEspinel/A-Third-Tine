Is this inspired by SSC?

You caught me. Yes.

Is it _shamelessly_ and _exclusively_ inspired by SSC?

Nah.

I have a genuine claim to being inspired by one of my very own god-awful, ill-informed, and overly-ignorant predictions.

Sure, we all have those moments. You probably thought the Cubs might lose in 2016. Or that the eleciton would go a different way.

What event did _I_ botch? Back in high school I spent a good three months blindly prophesizing an immenent double-dip in the Great Recession at the start of my 9AM Intro to Business class. Whew. I think I listened to a single podcast where some Modern Quantitative Oracle was reading tea leaves or something and I believed his apocalyptic interpretation of a few sprigs of Earl Grey.

So I was wrong.

Looking back on it last year I wondered if I could somehow improve my long run forecasting abilities and redeem myself.
