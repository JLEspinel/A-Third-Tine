Musiolik et. al. developed an intriguing solution in order to simulate Martian conditions and study their effect on saltation. It caught my eye as an engineering feat, and so I felt compelled to share it here on the blog. What follows is a very brief summary of the experiment and its results.

Somewhat akin to deserts on Earth, the Martian surface is covered in regolith comprised of sand and fine dust particles. On Earth, the influence of gravity and wind on soil transport is well understood, but the properties that govern those interactions break down when you look elsewhere in the solar system. Surface gravity differs among celestial bodies, and so do atmospheres: Earth's atmospheric composition and size varies from that of Venus or Mars. Studies have shown interaction between the the Martian surface and atmosphere (Gale Crater has seen dust devils), but atmospheric and gravitational inconsistencies complicate replicating such interactions back on Earth in a laboratory setting.

Instead of using low-density materials to simulate 0.38g Martian gravity and its thin atmosphere, the team built a test chamber. Part wind tunnel, part centrifuge, it housed a Mars soil simulant (JSC 1A) and could rotate fast enough to mimic the force of Martian gravity while in a microgravity environment.

Creating the microgravity environment involved another step: mounting the test chamber on a parabolic flight. For bouts of roughly 22 seconds, the flight replicated microgravity, which gave the test chamber roughly 20 seconds to begin rotating and pass a simulated Martian atmosphere over a dust bed.

The study found that at 0.38g, threshold fluid shear velocity for the simulant is "0.82 ± 0.04m/s and increases to 1.01 ± 0.04 m/s for 1g." They attributed the difference in velocities to reduced contact between particles.
