Is this inspired by SSC?

You caught me. Yes.

Is it _shamelessly_ and _exclusively_ inspired by SSC?

Nah.

I have a genuine claim to being inspired by one of my very own god-awful, ill-informed, and overly-ignorant predictions.

Sure, we all have those moments. You probably thought the Cubs might lose in 2016. Or that the eleciton would go a different way.

What event did _I_ botch? Back in high school I spent a good three months blindly prophesizing an immenent double-dip in the Great Recession at the start of my 9AM Intro to Business class. Whew. I think I listened to a single podcast where some Modern Quantitative Oracle was reading tea leaves or something and I believed his apocalyptic interpretation of a few sprigs of Earl Grey.

So I was wrong.

Looking back on it last year I wondered if I could somehow improve my long run forecasting abilities and redeem myself. 

Enter SSC.

I saw the 2017 calibration results and I was immediately hooked on the idea of trying my hand at the same exercise.

The only barrier was I'm no polymath (unlike Lucas), so I recruited a polymath (Lucas) to help me write a comprehensive list of events spanning a variety of disciplines.

What follows is our list of some possible outcomes in 2018, arranged by my varying degrees of certainty:

## 50%
- SpaceX's first falcon heavy launch successfully reaches orbit (no RUD).
- 
-
-
-

## 75%
- The number of combat troops stationed in Afghanistan at the end of 2018 is greater than at the end of 2017.
- Hamas does not execute a "third intifada" in Gaza.
- 
-
-

## 90%
- The United States avoids military action against North Korea.
- 
-
-
-

## 95%
-
-
-
-
-

## 99%
- SpaceX's Falcon Heavy embarks on its maiden flight.
- Apple's market cap exceeds 1 trillion USD.
- 
-
- Half-Life 3 is not released.

We'll check back on these in 2019.
