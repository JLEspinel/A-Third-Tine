I propose a toast to Lucas Szwarcberg, Dan Brickell, and [Scott Alexander](www.slatestarcodex.com) for inspring this site.

It took a month of living with Lucas and Dan in Tel Aviv to realize that I generally shared their ratonalist tendencies (although comparatively I knew nothing on the subject). After a fair amount of reading and introspection, I decided to assume the following two stances (I'm hesistant to call them "truths" for fear of contributing to part of the problem), which over time motivated me to start this blog: 

**1. The world needs better stories.**
If you were to set your internet browser's home page to, say, BBC news, you might see headlines like these on a daily basis:

> Hawaii missile false alarm triggers shock, blame and apologies

> Burning oil tanker sinks off China after one week

> French salmonella baby milk scandal 'affects 83 countries'

I merely scraped these from the BBC's front page today. Expect better memory in future posts (I'll dig back further through internet archives to give you a better idea of the effect I'm referring to). While you're sitting there fuming at me for not providing proper time series data, go ahead and try this exercise: either on paper or mentally (for you Jane Street types), make a record of the top three daily headlines on your preferred outlet over the past three weeks (hint: I'm not expecting you to remember precise headlines, that's not where this is leading). You'll probably find, as I did when I first tried this exercise, that it's hard to pin down exact words (in other words, you're not retaining much in terms of knowledge); emotions, however, are rather easy to recall. Most, for me, have been negative. And so here's the first reason why I take issue with using the news as your primary source of reading material: it's a constant emotional loop. In most cases, reading about the latest environmental tragedy or political misstep offers few challenges to our heuristics (where the news could be a novel developmental activity, like learning a language); nor does it foster creativity (where the news could be a recreational activity), since you feel the same emotions each time that a new story with similar characteristics (again, usually negative) is published.

Again, if you're mad here, don't hang me quite yet. I'm not saying that the news isn't valuable, or that reading it isn't worthwhile - poitically it's a vital insitution that preserves transparency and there are other countless benefits socially et. cetera that I don't want to get into right now - but it's a terribly shabby reading material, if you ascribe to the rational belief that the content you read factors into the economy of reading, and that in turn your content and the time you spend reading certain content should be optimized to maximize economy.

Another fun (and possibly controversial) point: shouldn't we also care _who_ writes the content we read? Around the same time I first tried that excerise from before, I was writing my first article for the Harvard Business Review. As I forged through the first draft, I spent a good deal of time hunting for a writing style to emulate. That's when I remembered some of the abysmal articles written by novice writers that I'd read on certain nameless tabloids in the past. If you're reading the news, and especially if you're reading less-than-reputable news, there's a fair chance that you'll encounter a new writer with little to add to the conversation, merely accumulating sufficient published pieces to climb to the next rung in their career (haha, I also noted someone might read my article and try to emulate a sorely underqualified undergrad). To me, it makes sense to spend most of your time reading content written by authors who write better and who have wiser things to say than you do. Emulating these authors gives you a better opportunity to improve your own style, and you probably learn a thing or two from what they've dumped out of their brains.

**2. More stories should be studied wholly and rationally, rather than in dogmatically congruent parts as is now in vogue.**

Yudkowski's "unenlightened one" is a curious person. The one is bound by heuristic shackles; vulnerable to cultism; the least likely to approach an objective study by exhaustively analyzing the merits of all an idea's parts, rather than the convenience of the whole.

And yet for most of history (including the present day) the one dominates the way many at large process the world around them. Not surprisingly, most of the stories we read end up being exercises in lazy thinking.

I'm very guilty of thinking poorly, too. But I've found that when I surround myself with good books and good people (don't do either/or - best to do both) I default to a more rational path. So here's my offer to you: check out this website every once in a while, and I'll promise to share something interesting that I think is worth reading and discussing with your friends.

Read a lot, write a little is the guiding principle behind this blog. If well executed, each post should boil down one or several interesting reads I've recently wandered into. If very well executed, each post should also be enjoyable - to the point you'll share it. Long shot, I know, but here's to a year of risks.
