**IT LIVES: this blog is back from the dead!**
Why now? Mainly thanks to three developments:
1. I got a job.
2. After kicking off this blog I switched to writing poetry and fell in love with it. That love has since petered out and I'm ready to write longer pieces again. Sorry Jason. If you do like poetry, I might cross-post or link some pieces published elsewhere earlier this year.
3. I have time to read again. Thanks to Development 1 I can read enough articles/books/papers to make this blog worth reading.

**NEW YEAR'S RESOLUTIONS: A CLEARER PURPOSE, REGULAR POSTS, AND TINKERING WITH FORMATS**

Here's the deal. I reread the published and unpublished (yes, I had about a half-dozen unfinished pieces dating back to February and March) posts from earlier this year, and eventually I made my way back to my first post.

I didn't like it. Okay - this is somewhat innacurate. I didn't think it correctly or clearly expressed why I made this blog or what it's meant to be. So here, in no uncertain terms, let me spell out a vision for ATT in 2019: A unique voice.

Still too vague? Fine. I'll give you an explanation and a list.

What I mean by a unique voice: here I'll do my best to explore subjects I find interesting. Hopefully you'll find them interesting too. And I'll explore those subjects by drawing on and sharing relevant literataure which I invite you to also read.

Here's how we'll get there in 2019:
- In the coming days, I'll post some older stuff. Mostly those unfinished things I'd started last spring.
- Beginning in January, expect regular posts on business, science, and philosophy. Some will take the form of longer quasi-research articles; others will be experiments with new formats (collaborations with friends, interviews, possibly even some podcasts). From now on I'll also probably organize posts by "series" (podcasts, astrophysics, philosophy, and so on).
