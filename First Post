I propose a toast to Lucas Szwarcberg, Dan Brickell, and [Scott Alexander](slatestarcodex.com) for inspring this site. Men undoubtedly cut from the same cloth.

Read a lot, write a little is the guiding principle behind this blog. If executed satisfactorily, each post should boil down one or several interesting reads I've recently wandered into. If executed excellently, each post should also be readable - to the point you'll share it. Long shot, I know.
