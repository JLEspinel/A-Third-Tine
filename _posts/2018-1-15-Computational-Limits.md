Outline:

- idea was convergent evolution from three sources:
	1. Conversation with Lucas Rosen
    2. Rationality: AI to Zombies, "Mind does not have floating point limitations"
    3. Slate Star Codex, "DMT superhuman being test (mental moonmen can't factor large numbers)"
- give Stanford definitions:
	- break down the components of a Turing machine
    1. block of memory
    2. symbols can be stored in block of memory
    3. computers are limited both by the speed of computations and by limited storage
    
- begs the question... what's the upper limit of human calculations, and is there a limit to the amount of informaiton the mind can store?

- are there empirically determined or postulated limits?
	- what's the history of these limits?
    - who has talked about it? any cool anecdotes?
    - where are they now?
