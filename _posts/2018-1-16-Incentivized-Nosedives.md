Space. Taxes. Politics. Am I reviewing the prequels? No. This is the story of an effect far more important than mass fan disappointment: reguatory races to the bottom.

Introductory game theory provides a good base to begin thinking about these sorts of scenarios. In the oligopolistic model of Bertrand competition, rival agents compete to sell substitutable products by decreasing prices to undercut their rivals.

The game ends when the firms hit their marginal cost - at which point the firm with less overhead wins out and captures the whole market. Victory goes to the cheapskate - but in many cases it's pyrrhic. [Gaining efficiency can compromise reliability](https://timeline.com/spacex-musk-rocket-failures-c22975218fbe).

Price-based competition doesn't just blow up rockets. I've found a whole host of situations, mainly in politics but with tendrils deep in several different fields, where attempts to be the "cheapest" option on the market has negative consequences as serious as they might be unintentional. In political spheres the oligopolistic, price-incentivized nosedive has a name: "race to the bottom". In this article I cover a few examples and offer a possible solution derived from basic economic theory.

## 1. First Movers in Asteroid Mining
I'm only going to loosely cite the first example since it's the one I'm most familiar with. Like many business-minded folks with an appreciation for aerospace and futurism, I was excited by the [Space Resources Exploration and Utilization Act of 2015](https://www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/house-bill/1508). For the first time, a major world power offered legal protections for private entities with off-world mining operations. It was also exciting for fans philosophy. The rights of resource extractors were partly derived from [Locke's definition of property rights](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/locke-political/#Pro). If Locke were thrown into the modern political environment, he'd say something like, "what you mine is what you own". And that's the stance the U.S. assumed: you want to mine an asteroid, fine; you can't own the whole rock, but you can own the little rocks you pick off of it, through your own (likely robotic) sweat and toil.

Hurrah for the United States. Italy issued a public "hurrah" at the United Nations. Russia booed loudly. See, the U.S. had essentially unilaterally declared legal protections that blatantly circumvented the UN Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space (COPUS). That ticked off the Russians and lots of other nations that collectively saw the looming shadow of the old economic bogeyman: the price war. Or as we've come to know it in the political context of this article, the "race to the bottom".

Luxembourg played the next move in the regulatory game. They goaded international asteroid mining companies with the promise of less security screening for their missions, which was basically a lower cost than what the U.S. could provide. Doing any sort of operations in space through the U.S. is notoriously difficult, thanks to rigorous checks conducted by intelligence and military agencies. Placing cameras and other neutral vessels in space consitutues a national security threat if you can't ascertain the inentions of thier operators. So U.S. agencies are rightly rigorous. And the international community at large also isn't too keen on opening the floodgates to unchecked activity in space. It seems, then, that we're stuck in the downward spiral. Marginal cost is nowhere in sight but concievably it does exisit.
